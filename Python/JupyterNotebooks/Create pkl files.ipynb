even have refunded the Hellbronner ones if we hadnâ€™t used then).', 'We already knew that we wanted to go on as many of the lifts as possible so went for the 6 day multipass which wasnâ€™t cheap at

make a reservation (free with the Multipass).', 'In the end, we had a reservation for the Monday morning but ended up going the previous Saturday morning as the weather looked perfect.', 'We only ended up having to queue for about 30 mins so this was definitely the right decision.', 'Make no mistake, the Aiguille is very high up and if you have anything more than mild vertigo then you may find it too much.', 'I felt dizzy and panicky the whole 3 hrs that we were up there but it was definitely worth it for the views.', 'There was a massive queue for the elevator to the very top so we didnâ€™t do that but there were no queues at all for Helbronner so we had a cabin all to ourselves â€“ this is definitely well worth the extra 25 euros as the scenery is amazing.', 'There is lots to

surroundings.', '.-\\tBellevue/Prarion/Tramway du Mont Blanc â€“ we really liked it up here as the scenery was very pretty and there was hardly anyone around.', 'If we were to go back, I would go to the top of Prarion first, then walk down to the Tramway stop at Col De Voza, take the Tramway up to the terminus and then walk back to Bellevue.', '.-\\tGorges de la Diosaz â€“ A good place to go to

ever been too but a good rainy day option.', 'The labelling is mainly in French but they do have translations..-\\tEspace Tairraz â€“ this currently houses the Crystal Museum and a Mountain Climbing
