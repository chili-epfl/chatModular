# IrisTK

This is the repository for IrisTK - a Java-based framework for developing multi-modal interactive systems. 

Unlike the distribution on the IrisTK website, the code here does not contain any Java binaries, so it must first be compiled (in Eclipse). To do so, open a command prompt and go to the IrisTK folder, from there run "iristk install". Then you can import the project into Eclipse, and it will be compiled.
