### A Dialog System Framework

IrisTK is a Java-based framework for developing multi-modal interactive systems. IrisTK provides:

* A framework for building event-based, modular interactive systems.
* A statechart-based XML formalism for defining the dialog flow.
* Generic interfaces for input and output components across different modalities (speech recognition, speech synthesis, vision, animation, etc)
* Input and output components for 
	* Windows ASR & TTS
	* Microsoft Kinect
	* Google ASR
	* Nuance Recognizer 9 and Cloud-based ASR 
	* Facial animation
* A 3D situation modelling framework which makes it possible to model situated interaction, including multiple users talking to the system and objects being discussed. 
* Support for distributed systems (over processes and/or machines)
* Logging of events and audio 

### A Social Robotics Platform

IrisTK is especially designed to be a powerful framework for social robotics applications. IrisTK is used as a software platform for the [Furhat robot head](http://www.furhatrobotics.com) developed by [Furhat Robotics](http://www.furhatrobotics.com). You can start using the animated agent that comes with IrisTK, and then easily connect Furhat to your system by changing one line of code. Then you can also upload your application to Furhat as a "skill".

### Usage

IrisTK has been used in many experiments and demonstrations at the [Department of Speech Music and Hearing, KTH](http://www.speech.kth.se). 
Here is an example where it is used. The video is best viewed in 1080p and fullscreen.

IrisTK is also excellent for education. You can see some examples of what students have created with it [here](examples.html).
